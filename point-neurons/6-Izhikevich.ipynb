    "# Izhikevich Neuron Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The Izhikevich model is a computationally efficient neuron model that can reproduce diverse firing patterns observed in real neurons by combining the biophysical accuracy of Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics with the computational efficiency of integrate-and-fire neurons.. Despite having only two state variables and a small number of parameters, the model can generate a rich variety of neuronal behaviors including regular spiking, bursting, chattering, and more.\n",
